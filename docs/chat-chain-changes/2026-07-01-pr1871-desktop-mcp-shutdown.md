commit: 3e82cf10
feature: Desktop MCP shutdown
impact: Desktop bridge shutdown now asks profile workers to close registered MCP servers before terminating worker processes.

Bundled Hermes-own MCP configs generated for Web UI injection and coding-agent launches now prefer the packaged runtime node from `HERMES_AGENT_NODE` when it is available. This keeps desktop MCP subprocesses on the managed runtime while preserving the existing `process.execPath` fallback outside desktop runtime.
