| Distribution | Ships as a desktop app for Windows/macOS/Linux, an npm CLI package, and a Docker image. |

## Features

### AI Chat

- Real-time chat streaming over Socket.IO `/chat-run`; chat runs execute through the Hermes agent bridge
- Multi-session management — create, rename, delete, switch between sessions
- **Self-built session database** — local SQLite storage for Web UI sessions; Hermes state.db remains a read-only source for Hermes history APIs
- Session grouping by source (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.) with collapsible accordion
- Active session indicator — live sessions pin to top with spinner icon
- Sessions sorted by latest message time
- Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting and code copy
- Tool call detail expansion (arguments / result)
- Profile-scoped file uploads
- File download support — download uploaded files and agent-generated files by resolved path across local, Docker, SSH, and Singularity backends
- Session search — Ctrl+K search across the Web UI local session database; read-only Hermes history sessions are not included
- Profile-aware model selector — discovers models available to the signed-in account through authorized Hermes profiles
- Per-session model display badge and context token usage

### Platform Channels

Unified configuration for **8 platforms** in one page:

| Platform      | Features                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telegram      | Bot token, mention control, reactions, free-response chats             |
| Discord       | Bot token, mention, auto-thread, reactions, channel allow/ignore lists |

- OpenAI Codex & Nous Portal OAuth login
- Provider URL auto-detection for non-v1 API versions (e.g. `/v4`)
- Provider-level model grouping with default model switching

### Multi-Profile

- Create, rename, delete, and switch between Hermes profiles
- Clone existing profile or import from archive (`.tar.gz`)
- Export profile for backup or sharing
- Profile-scoped configuration, cache, uploads, sessions, jobs, usage, memory, skills, plugins, providers, and model visibility
- Account-bound profile access: super administrators can manage every profile; regular administrators only see and use profiles assigned to their account

### File Browser

- Browse files on remote backends (local, Docker, SSH, Singularity)
- Upload, download, rename, copy, move, and delete files
- Store uploaded files under the selected/requested Hermes profile while keeping downloads path-based for agent-generated artifacts outside the upload directory
- Create directories

### Skills & Memory

- Browse and search installed skills
- View skill details and attached files
- User notes and profile management

### Logs

- View agent / server / error logs
- Filter by log level, log file, and keyword
- Structured log parsing with HTTP access log highlighting

### Admin & Runtime Management

- Device and LAN peer views for local-network discovery and peer tooling
- MCP manager for the managed `hermes-own` MCP server and profile injection
- Runtime version and version-preview tooling for testing newer builds in isolation
- Performance monitor views for super administrators

### Authentication

- Token-based auth (auto-generated on first run or set via `AUTH_TOKEN` env var)
- Username/password login with account management in Settings
- Default bootstrap credentials are `admin` / `123456`; users are prompted after login to change the default username and password
- Super administrators can manage users and profile bindings; regular administrators can manage their own account details

CLI maintenance commands:

```bash
# Delete persisted login IP lock records
hermes-own clear-login-locks

# Delete login locks and restart the running Web UI process
hermes-own clear-login-locks --restart

# Create or reset the default super administrator login to admin / 123456
hermes-own reset-default-login
```

`clear-login-locks` removes `${HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME:-~/.hermes-own}/.login-lock.json`. If the server is running, restart it to clear in-memory lock state. `reset-default-login` updates the Web UI account database; if an `admin` user already exists, its password is reset to `123456` and the account is enabled as a super administrator.

### Settings

- Display (streaming, compact mode, reasoning, cost display)
- Agent (max turns, timeout, tool enforcement)
- Memory (enable/disable, char limits)
- Session reset (idle timeout, scheduled reset)
- Privacy (PII redaction)
- Model settings (default model & provider)
- Profile and provider configuration

### Voice / TTS / STT

- Read assistant replies aloud from chat and group-chat messages.
- Providers: browser Web Speech, built-in Edge TTS, OpenAI-compatible `/audio/speech`, custom OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoints, and MiMo.
- MiMo supports preset voices, voice design prompts, and voice clone reference audio (`.mp3`/`.wav`, max 10 MB) with selectable auth header mode (`Authorization`, `api-key`, or both).
- Edge/OpenAI-compatible/custom/MiMo playback uses the Web UI backend's unified `/api/hermes/tts/synthesize` endpoint, so stop/pause state is shared and in-flight fetches are aborted when possible.
- Provider API keys and MiMo clone reference audio are saved in server-side TTS settings, with only masked secret status shown back to the browser.
- Save provider settings in Settings → Voice before using OpenAI/custom/MiMo playback. Message playback sends text and non-secret playback options; the backend reads the stored per-user secret when synthesizing.
- Turn-based voice input is available from the chat input mic control: start/stop a voice turn, transcribe it, stage the transcript in the current input box for editing, then send it with the normal Send button.
- Voice input / STT can use browser speech recognition when available or a server-backed provider configured in Settings → Voice.
- Starting a new voice turn while assistant audio is playing stops playback first. This barge-in boundary does not implicitly cancel an active agent run; stopping a run remains an explicit action.
- For supported settings, security notes, and current non-goals, see [`docs/voice-dialogue.md`](./docs/voice-dialogue.md).
- Limitation: external TTS providers may continue processing a request after the browser/server aborts; custom/OpenAI-compatible and MiMo base URLs must be public `http`/`https` endpoints and cannot target localhost/private networks.

### Web Terminal

- Integrated terminal powered by node-pty and @xterm/xterm
- Multi-session support — create, switch between, and close terminal sessions
- Real-time keyboard input and PTY output streaming via WebSocket
- Window resize support

### Desktop App & Updates

- Native Electron shell for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Bundles the Web UI runtime and starts the local Hermes-own server automatically
- Uses Cloudflare download endpoints for desktop auto-update metadata and assets first
- Falls back to GitHub Releases `latest` assets if the Cloudflare update feed is unavailable
- Windows upgrades attempt to close an existing Hermes-own process before replacing files

---

## Quick Start

### Desktop App (Recommended)

Download the latest **Hermes-own** desktop installer from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zhemed/Hermes-own/releases/latest).

Desktop builds are published for macOS, Windows, and Linux, with separate
architecture assets where applicable. The desktop app bundles the Web UI
runtime and stores Hermes Agent data in the native Hermes location:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` (falls back to `%APPDATA%\hermes`)
- macOS/Linux: `~/.hermes`

The desktop wrapper stores its own Web UI state separately in
`~/.hermes-own` unless `HERMES_WEB_UI_HOME` is set.

After the packaged desktop app starts, it installs managed command shims so the
desktop app, bundled Hermes Agent CLI, and bundled Web UI CLI do not conflict:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hermes-own` | Open the Hermes-own desktop app |
| `hermes-own cli ...` | Run the bundled Hermes Agent CLI |
| `hermes-own web ...` | Run the bundled `hermes-own` command |
| `hermes-own -h` | Show wrapper help |
| `hermes-own-mcp` | Run the managed Web UI MCP bridge |

Use `hermes-own cli -h` for Hermes Agent CLI help and
`hermes-own web -h` for Web UI CLI help.

Desktop auto-updates read the latest feed from
`https://github.com/zhemed/Hermes-own/releases/latest/download` first. If that endpoint is
unavailable, the updater falls back to
`https://github.com/zhemed/Hermes-own/releases/latest/download`.

### npm

```bash
npm install -g hermes-own
hermes-own start
```

Open **http://localhost:8648**

### Docker Compose

Single-container deployment with integrated Hermes Agent:

```bash
# Use pre-built image (Recommended)
WEBUI_IMAGE=ekkoye8888/hermes-own docker compose up -d

# Or build from source
docker compose up -d --build

docker compose logs -f hermes-own
```

Open **http://localhost:6060**

- Persistent Hermes data is stored in `./hermes_data`
- Web UI auth token is stored in `./hermes_data/hermes-own/.token`
- On first run with auth enabled, the token is printed to container logs
- All runtime settings are environment-variable driven in `docker-compose.yml`

For detailed notes and troubleshooting, see [`docs/docker.md`](./docs/docker.md).

### Hermes Agent Runtime Discovery

When Web UI starts backend chat features, it prefers a source checkout that
contains `run_agent.py` such as `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`. If no source checkout
is found, it falls back to the Python environment used by the installed
`hermes` command, then the system Python. This supports both source installs
and package installs such as `pip install hermes-agent`.

## Web UI Environment Variables

These variables configure Hermes-own, its local Hermes runtime integration, and development/preview helpers. Provider API keys and Hermes Agent settings are normally managed through Hermes profiles; environment variables here are process-level overrides.

### CLI Commands

| Command                           | Description                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `hermes-own start`             | Start in background (daemon mode)  |
| `hermes-own start --port 9000` | Start on custom port               |
| `hermes-own stop`              | Stop background process            |
| `hermes-own restart`           | Restart background process; stops the bridge by default |
| `hermes-own status`            | Check if running                   |
| `hermes-own update`            | Update to latest version & restart |
| `hermes-own upgrade`           | Alias for `update`                 |
| `hermes-own -v`                | Show version number                |
| `hermes-own -h`                | Show help message                  |

`restart`, `update`, and `upgrade` stop the Agent Bridge broker by default so restarted or updated servers do not reuse stale Python bridge processes. Set `HERMES_AGENT_BRIDGE_STOP_ON_SHUTDOWN=0` before restarting only when you explicitly want to keep the bridge broker and running bridge sessions alive.

`update` / `upgrade` first attempt `npm cache clean --force`, then run `npm install -g hermes-own@latest` and restart. Cache cleanup is best-effort; if it fails, the updater continues with the install.

### Auto Configuration

On startup the BFF server automatically:

- Initializes Web UI data directories, local databases, and bundled skills
- Starts the Hermes agent bridge used by `/chat-run`
- Opens browser on successful startup

---

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhemed/Hermes-own.git
cd hermes-own
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:8649
- BFF Server: http://localhost:8647

```bash
npm run build   # outputs to dist/
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for project development guidelines.

## Architecture

```
Browser → BFF (Koa, :8648) → Socket.IO /chat-run
                ↓
        Hermes agent bridge → Hermes Agent runtime
                ↓
           Hermes CLI / profiles
           profile config.yaml    (channel/provider behavior)
           profile auth.json      (credential pool)
           Tencent iLink API      (WeChat QR login)
```

The frontend is designed with **multi-agent extensibility** — all Hermes-specific code is namespaced under `hermes/` directories (API, components, views, stores), making it straightforward to add new agent integrations alongside.

The BFF layer handles Socket.IO chat streaming, the Hermes agent bridge, profile-aware file upload and path-based download (multi-backend: local/Docker/SSH/Singularity), session CRUD, account- and profile-scoped management, config/credential management, WeChat QR login, model discovery, skills/memory/plugin management, TTS/STT, coding-agent proxies, MCP/runtime management, log reading, and static file serving.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Naive UI + Pinia + Vue Router + vue-i18n + SCSS + markdown-it + highlight.js

**Backend:** Koa 2 (BFF server) + node-pty (web terminal)
